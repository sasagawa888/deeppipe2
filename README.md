# End of development

I will leave it to GPGPU in the official project of Elixir. Previously, the Japanese advocated GPGPU at the world Elixir conference . After that, I felt responsible as the same Japanese for the lack of progress. My work is over because the regular project (Nx) has been launched.

# DeepPipe2
DeepPipe2 is a library of Deep-Learning by Elixir using GPU. It is fast because it uses CUDA/cuBLAS. 

# getting started
DeepPipe2 requires GPU. Nvidia's GeForce is easy. The game PC turns into an AI experiment tool.

```
(1)install CUDA
If you have not yet installed CUDA, install it from the Nvidia website.
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

(2)make clone 
Linux is recommended for OS. DeepPipe2 does not work on Windows.
After installing CUDA, make a clone of DeepPipe2.
git clone https://github.com/sasagawa888/deeppipe2.git

(3)invoke Deeppipe2
Change to the deeppipe2 directory with the CD command. 
Start with iex -S mix. mix compiles CUDA code automatically.

(4)download dataset
iex(1)> Deeppipe.download(:mnist)
Deeppipe will prepare MNIST dataset 

(5)learning
iex(2)> MNIST.sgd(100,10).


When you test other dataset use Deeppipe.download(x)
x is dataset name atom. 
:fashion  (Fashion-MNIST)
:cifar10  (CIFAR10)
:iris     (IRIS)

Network descriptions are Elixir-like pipeline operators. 
See the mnist.ex file. The random number given to the weight matrix and bias affects learning.
The learning rate also has an effect. The default for each is 0.1.
You can change it with w(300,100,0.2,0.5) in defnetwork.
In this example, the multiple to the random number is 0.2 and the learning rate is 0.5.
It is important to find these parameters in Deep-Learning.
```

Please enjoy.

## install
require CUDA.

Make clone or download.

on terminal 

```
$iex -S mix

```

## example
MNIST 100 mini batch size, 2 epochs.

```
# for DNN test
  defnetwork init_network1(_x) do
    _x 
    |> w(784,300) 
    |> b(300) 
    |> relu
    |> w(300,100) 
    |> b(100) 
    |> relu
    |> w(100,10) 
    |> b(10) 
    |> softmax
  end
